A BMW I/K-BUS ~~interface~~ _tool thingy_ written in Ruby.

### Description

The project was started as a means add support for streaming music, and handsfree calls over Bluetooth. A RaspberryPi as a Bluetooth endpoint with support for the necessary Bluetooth profiles, with middleware to emulating IBUS music and telephony devices in the hope of having as native/smooth integration as possible.

Yes, you can retrofit OEM Bluetooth/AUX and so on, but for some reason I like the pain. Well, perhaps being indoctrinated into German electronics will make the drivetrain swap easier?

Made with a combination of enthusiasm and apparent self loathing in Melbourne, Australia.

### Features

I'm still in the throws of tinkering with the bus, and software currently reflects that and is more of a personal toolkit for said tinkering. However the objectives are:


- language agnostic bus interface ~~(i.e. JSON payloads via pipes/RabbitMQ etc)~~ _YAML over ZeroMQ_
- as many of the commands mapped as possible to facilitate a variety of integrations beyond my initial goal music/telephony, or simple observation of the bus, akin to [NavCoder](http://www.navcoder.com/).
- diagnostic (INPA) commands mapped to allow additional features like showing module coding data, vehicle control, or parking sensor data which is only available via diagnostics.
- comprehensive API to allow use of the mapped commands.
- high level API to abstract the occasionally obscure behaviour (I'm looking at _you_ IKE character display...)

### Progress

28 January 2019

- A rudimentary framework for an extensible UI has been implemented.
- Currently this just applies to the radio mode menus as I figure out how to best handle notifications callbacks. These are likely to be implemented via the radio mode header/overlay with will mean that contention for the header will need to be considered.
- I've pulled the majority of the modules related to the I/K-Bus from my 540i. I've fashioned some rudimentary wiring harnesses and adapters to install the BM53 radio and ~~MK3~~ MK4 navigation computer. (I found an MK4 for less than most MK3s go for in AU.)

22 December 2018

- Streaming audio via Bluetooth has been implemented in semi-reasonable form. The heavy lifting is been done by Bluez which has support for the A2DP and AVRCP profiles out of the box via PulseAudio, and offers an API over the D-BUS. A second project- Wilhelm, makes the Bluez D-BUS API a little friendlier and emulates an car kit for the purposes of acting as broker for the vehicle.
- Wilhelm communicates with this library via ZeroMQ using a common message standard.

17 October 2018

As mentioned above, it's current state is a reflection of my needs while I'm exploring the bus rather than being a useful library. Until the software is more.. definitive in it's functionality it can be found on [develop](https://github.com/piersholt/walter/tree/develop).

- the most common commands have be mapped, but I'm still figuring out a number of obscure flags in the bit arrays.
- I have captured most of the diagnostic commands that are relayed over the I/K BUS, but haven't mapped them as yet.
- there is a number of rudimentary APIs to allow writing a subset of commands to the bus. There is no hardware flow control or carrier sensing, merely collision detection and arbitrary retry attempts.
- bus data is logged to allow 'replaying' the traffic.

### Notes

- Developed using Rolf Resler's v6b USB [interface](http://www.reslers.de/IBUS/index.html). I
- While Rolf has implemented hardware flow control signals, the Silicon Labs CP2102 USB UART Bridge does not appear to support signals under OS X (or at least under 10.10.5, with SiLabs 4.x drivers). The signals appear a-okay under Windows.
- The vehicles used in development were a 1997 BMW E39 528i Touring, and 2001 BMW E39 540i, both with High IKE.
- The 528i (to which I have best access) has water damaged amplifier and nav. computer so related commands are a little vague/possibly utterly wrong.
- I'll fill in the gaps with the 540i when I can.
