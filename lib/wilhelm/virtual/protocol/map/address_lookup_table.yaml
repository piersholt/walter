# NOTES

# [1] LCM is queried by diagnostics prior to sending commands to
#     LWR control unit. Possibly a determine which LWR system in place?
# [2] Active Seat mighn't be at 0x00. Possibly similar to LWR, which
#     is messaged following a query to LCM.
# [3] Earlier versions of MRS have control units that will only communicate
#     via diagnostics, despite being accessed via K-Bus.

# UNCONFIRMED

                # Did the infrared keyless entry FBZV not interface directly
                # with the ZKE, and have intermediary control unit on the
                # K-Bus? Long shot...

                # Virtual address akin to GT or TV?
                # Navi. GT sends the below whenever Main Menu is rendered:
                # 7F 04 43 AB 21 B2
                # After some wildcard testing, 0xAA can be used to load GPS navigation:
                # 43 04 7F AA 01 93
                # I'm guessing E38 video module has discrete GT for RCM,
                # and similar to TV, selecting GPS from the rear will switch
                # video signal to Navi- thus the need to control the Nav UI.
