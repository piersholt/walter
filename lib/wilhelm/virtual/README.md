`wilhelm-virtual`

- This models the vehicle bus and provides a intermediate interface to the vehicle.
- Each modelled device has a command API that maps to commands applicable to the device
- A more useful, abstracted API sits atop this to model key features, and avoid the need for
knowledge of the commands
